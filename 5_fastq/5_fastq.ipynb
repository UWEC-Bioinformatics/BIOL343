    "In previous weeks, we explored the genome and annotations. There were stored in FASTA and GTF files and will be used as the reference to which RNA sequencing reads are mapped/aligned. After alignment, we can count how many RNA-seq reads align to the annotations we care about (genes or transcripts). Now we need to get the FASTQ files that we want to align and analyze. To do so, we will be referencing an SRA read table, which is a list of all the FASTQ files associated with a given experiment uploaded to NCBI SRA. Here's the read table for the Winners vs. Losers experiment:"

First, these reads were generated with `PolyA` selection, which means reads should have many A's on their 3' end. Second, the reads are `ILLUMINA` reads generated on a `NextSeq 500` instrument, which means they may have Illumina adapters, depending on whether or not they were trimmed by the authors prior to uploading them to SRA. Third, from the paper (but not the run table), we know that these are single-end reads. This metadata will be important to us soon. You can get a bit more information about the data using the tool `seqkit`. For instance:"

    "Let's go through each section one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per base sequence quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Base quality scores are represented in Phred+33 encoding. Remember that Q20 is a popular threshold, as the likelihood of an error substantially increases as the Phred quality gets less than 20. It is typical to see high base quality at the 5' end of reads and lower quality at the 3' ends. For this reason, sometimes the 3' end of reads may be trimmed to remove low quality bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per tile sequence quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiles are physical locations on the flow cell. Warnings in this section can be associated with flow cells that have been overloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per sequence quality scores\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution shows that average Phred quality for entire reads. It helps you make decisions about removing entire reads based on their average quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per base sequence content\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution shows the bases most likely to be found at any given position in the reads. In general, the likelihood of finding any of A, T, G, or C at a given position should be the same across the entire sequence. Deviations from this expectation may be due to the presence of barcodes, adaptors, UMIs, UMI linkers, or PolyA tails. Here's an example of a dataset that has the UMI linker on the 5' end.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/linker.png\" alt=\"UMI linker\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per sequence GC content\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our reads are derived from mRNA fragments, we would expect that the percentage of Gs and Cs would be normally distributed in a way that mimics the underlying transcriptome of the organism from which the mRNA was extracted. If the distribution isn't normal (that is, if there are sharp peaks), that is an indication of some sort of contamination. Here is an example of a sharp peak:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/gc_peak.png\" alt=\"GC\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This peak is indicative of something in the library that has a higher GC% than the rest of the mRNA. Sharp peaks are often associated with adaptor dimers. These are reads generated from two adaptors that were ligated together during library prep - they have the sequencing primer binding site, but they don't have an insert. Here's the adaptor sequence used for this library, with Gs and Cs annotated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC = 34\n",
    "x  xxx  x xx x xx x x  x xx x x x = 18\n",
    "18 / 34 = 53%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it would make sense that if many reads are associated with adaptor dimers, these reads would have a significantly higher GC% than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per base N content\n",
    "\n",
    "Ns are called when the base caller can't make a decision for that cycle. N calls are usually associated (and correlated) with per base sequence quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence length distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sequencing libraries will have non-uniform read lengths, in which case we'd see a distribution of different lenghts. For runs that have a pre-defined read lenght, we should see a sharp peak at that length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence duplication levels\n",
    "\n",
    "For this module, FastQC will scan the first 50 bp of the first 100,000 reads and tally duplicates. The best libraries will have almost no, if any, duplicates. High levels of duplication may be indicative of PCR over amplification. Sometimes over amplification is a desired outcome; in this case, highly expressed transcripts will be highly duplicated, but this is a tradeoff for recovering more lowly experssed transcripts. FASTQs can be deduplicated before or after the alignment step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overrepresented sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have many duplicate reads, it's likely there are overrepresented sequences. You can also use this list of sequences to help evalulate if you have adaptor dimers. A simple way to check for problems is to search a sequence database for the overrepresented sequence. If it hits to a sequences deriving from your organism of interest, then you don't have a problem and this overrepresentation may be indicative of true underlying biology. The most useful search tool is BLAST. You can use [this website](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to BLAST the sequences against the NCBI's entire nucleotide database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adapter content\n",
    "\n",
    "This module searches reads for popular adaptors and PolyA stretches. If you performed mRNA enrichment, you may see higher PolyA instances at either end of the reads. \n",
    "\n",
    "## FastQC evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly evaluate these QC data, we need to consider how the library was prepared. This consideration will give us an idea of what (if any) adaptors we may expect to see, how much sequence duplication might be present, and if PolyA tails are expected. From the [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012268#sec010), we know that they used the QuantSeq 3' mRNA FWD V2 library prep kit with UMI Second Strand Synthesis and 6 nt Unique Dual Indexing (UDI). You can read a bit about the kit [here](https://www.lexogen.com/store/quantseq-3-mrna-seq-v2-fwd-with-udi/). This kit is optimized for a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degraded mRNA - it will only get sequences from the 3' end (and PolyA tails)\n",
    "- Low input RNA - which is often the case for small eukaryotic parasites, especially when working with eggs, which are difficult to get RNA out of\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how library prep works. When doing PolyA selection, an oligo(dT) primer will be used for first-strand cDNA synthesis and a random primer will be used for second strand synthesis. The library is then amplified, during which barcodes and P5/P7 are added. Here's the schematic from Lexogen:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/library_prep.png\" alt=\"library prep\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The QuantSeq 3' mRNA FWD V2 library also allows for incorporation of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) during second strand synthesis. This UMI will be present during the amplification step, which means that each read then has the UMI tag that informs which *original fragment* the read was derived from. The UMI is 6 bp long and has TATA immediately after it, prior to the insert. This tells us how many duplicated reads are present in the data. Here's what that looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/umi.png\" alt=\"UMI\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this information, we can make the following inferences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are likely to have PolyA tails\n",
    "- We may see UMIs and UMI linkers (TATA)\n",
    "- Because the RNA was low-input, some duplicated sequences are to be expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take some time to look at all the FastQC files and see if there are any other problems that should be noted."

    "# FASTQ trimming and filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "QC metrics will inform whether or not reads should be trimmed (i.e., PolyA tails, low quality bases, or adaptors removed) or filtered (low quality reads removed). Typically, manufacturers will provide some guidance on how to trim and filter sequences produced from their kit. For Lexogen (the maker of the QuantSeq kit), this information can be found in the [FAQs](https://faqs.lexogen.com/faq/what-sequences-should-be-trimmed). This site shows that `AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC` is the adapter sequence. Is that sequence (or one like it) in the \"Overrepresented sequences\" section? If so, we need to trim the adapter. If not, we just need to trim the PolyA tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the authors of the paper said about read QC:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Quality control of raw reads was performed in FastQC (v0.11.9). Reads were mapped to the S. mansoni genome (Wormbase ParaSite v9) using STAR aligner (version 2.7.10a) with options adjusted to the QuantSeq FWD 3’mRNA Library Prep Kit. The UMIs were deduplicated using open source UMI-tools software package (version 1.1.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they did look at QC, they say nothing about trimming or filtering. They do mention that they deduplicated reads using UMI-tools. We won't be able to reproduce this because the reads that we fetched from NCBI SRA don't all have UMIs, some only have the UMI linker (TATA).\n",
    "\n",
    "For QuantSeq libraries, each read may include a 6 nt UMI, a 4 nt (TATA) linker, the insert, the PolyA tail, and then the adapter. Based on our QC data, it looks like the adapters have been trimmed (`AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC` isn't overrepresented). The PolyA tail *may* have been trimmed, but it's not obvious - we still see up to 40% PolyA at position 59 in SRR26691093. On the other side of the read, we see TATA in all 4 files, and SRR26691093 and SRR26691087 contain the 6 nt UMI while SRR26691085 and SRR26691082 do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We definitely want to trim PolyA tails, but trimming UDIs and linkers actually depends on the type of aligner being used. STAR (the aligner we'll be using) can soft-clip the ends of reads that have a high mismatch rate. This also means that we don't need to trim low-quality bases, because they can also be soft-clipped. What about the duplicates? Again, those can be marked during alignment, so we don't need to remove them either.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we'll just trim PolyA tails and do some trimming that's particular to the NextSeq instrument that we're not going to get into. We will use the tool [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to perform the trimming. First, check out the manual:"
