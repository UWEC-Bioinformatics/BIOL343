Speaking of SAM files, we'll also set an option to create BAMs instead of SAMs and to sort these files by coordinate.

In this scheme, the first pass maps to the known splice junctions provided in the GTF while the second pass re-maps to known and novel junctions (which are output in `SJ.out.tab`.

However, down the road we are going to want to differentiate reads from each FASTQ, because we'll want to know if a given transcript was differentially expressed between tissues/treatment groups. To help differentiate, the output file is going to have a RG tag in the header of each aligned read (more on that later). The important thing to know now is we need to provide STAR with a RG (read group) ID for each FASTQ. We can do that be creating a tab-separated file (TSV) that is called the \"manifest\" and directing START to it with `--readFilesManifest /path/to/manifest.tsv`. That manifest should have 3 columns: `read1-file-name tab - tab read-group-line`, e.g.:\n",
