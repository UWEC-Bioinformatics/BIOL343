    "\n",
    "### Per base sequence quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Base quality scores are represented in Phred+33 encoding. Remember that Q20 is a popular threshold, as the likelihood of an error substantially increases as the Phred quality gets less than 20. It is typical to see high base quality at the 5' end of reads and lower quality at the 3' ends. For this reason, sometimes the 3' end of reads may be trimmed to remove low quality bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per tile sequence quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiles are physical locations on the flow cell. Warnings in this section can be associated with flow cells that have been overloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per sequence quality scores\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution shows that average Phred quality for entire reads. It helps you make decisions about removing entire reads based on their average quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per base sequence content\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution shows the bases most likely to be found at any given position in the reads. In general, the likelihood of finding any of A, T, G, or C at a given position should be the similar across the entire sequence. Deviations from this expectation may be due to the presence of barcodes or adaptors. Here's an example of a dataset that has the adapter on the 5' end.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/linker.png\" alt=\"linker\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per sequence GC content\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our reads are derived from mRNA fragments, we would expect that the percentage of Gs and Cs would be normally distributed in a way that mimics the underlying transcriptome of the organism from which the mRNA was extracted. If the distribution isn't normal (that is, if there are sharp peaks), that is an indication of some sort of contamination. Here is an example of a sharp peak:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/gc_peak.png\" alt=\"GC\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This peak is indicative of something in the library that has a higher GC% than the rest of the mRNA. Sharp peaks are often associated with adapter dimers. These are reads generated from two adapters that were ligated together during library prep - they have the sequencing primer binding site, but they don't have an insert. Here's the adaptor sequence used for this library, with Gs and Cs annotated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC = 34\n",
    " x  xxx  x xx x xx x x  x xx x x x = 18\n",
    "18 / 34 = 53%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it would make sense that if many reads are associated with adaptor dimers, these reads would have a significantly higher GC% than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per base N content\n",
    "\n",
    "Ns are called when the base caller can't make a decision for that cycle. N calls are usually associated (and correlated) with per base sequence quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence length distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sequencing libraries will have non-uniform read lengths, in which case we'd see a distribution of different lenghts. For runs that have a pre-defined read lenght, we should see a sharp peak at that length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence duplication levels\n",
    "\n",
    "For this module, FastQC will scan the first 50 bp of the first 100,000 reads and tally duplicates. The best libraries will have almost no, if any, duplicates. High levels of duplication may be indicative of PCR over amplification. Sometimes over amplification is a desired outcome; in this case, highly expressed transcripts will be highly duplicated, but this is a tradeoff for recovering more lowly expressed transcripts. FASTQs can be deduplicated before or after the alignment step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overrepresented sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have many duplicate reads, it's likely there are overrepresented sequences. You can also use this list of sequences to help evalulate if you have adapter dimers. A simple way to check for problems is to search a sequence database for the overrepresented sequence. If it hits to a sequences deriving from your organism of interest, then you don't have a problem and this overrepresentation may be indicative of true underlying biology. The most useful search tool is BLAST. You can use [this website](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to BLAST the sequences against the NCBI's entire nucleotide database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adapter content\n",
    "\n",
    "This module searches reads for popular adapters and PolyA stretches. If you performed mRNA enrichment, you may see higher PolyA instances at either end of the reads. "

    "# FASTQ trimming and filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "QC metrics will inform whether or not reads should be trimmed (i.e., PolyA tails, low quality bases, or adapters removed) or filtered (low quality reads removed). Typically, manufacturers will provide some guidance on how to trim and filter sequences produced from their kit. For Illumina (the maker of the TruSeq kit used in the paper), this information can be found in the [FAQs](https://support-docs.illumina.com/SHARE/AdapterSequences/Content/SHARE/AdapterSeq/TruSeq/UDIndexes.htm). This site shows that `AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA` is the adapter sequence for read 1 and `AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` is the adapter sequence for read 2. However, our FastQC eval for these data show that there are no adapters or overrepresented sequences, which means they've likely already been trimmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the authors of the paper said about read QC:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Trimmed reads were mapped to the Schistosoma mansoni genome (v7.2)...\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they likely looked at QC, they say nothing about how they trimmed or filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we'll just trim low quality sequences from the end (using Q = 20 as a threshold). We will use the tool [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to perform the trimming. First, check out the manual:"
