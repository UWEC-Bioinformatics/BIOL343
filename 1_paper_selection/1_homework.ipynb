    "To include figures in Markdown, copy the image (JPG, PNG, etc.) to `1_paper_selection/assets/` and include the Markdown code: `![Image alt text](assets/{filename})`. The image will be rendered when the Markdown document is processed. If you want to adjust the size of the image, you have to use HTML tags. Examples can be found by lookinga the Markdown syntax in `1_paper.selection.ipynb`, i.e., `<img src=\"assets/journal.ppat.1012268.g001.PNG\" alt=\"experiment data\" width=\"600\">`\n",
