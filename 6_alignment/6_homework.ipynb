    "In contrast to last week (FASTQ files), there aren't as many decisions that need to be made during alignment, so using a notebook to control and report code isn't as necessary. As you saw in in [6_alignment](6_alignment.ipynb), file and directory management can get complicated during alignment. This is a case where Snakemake scripting shines.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy your `Snakefile` and `config.yaml` from `5_fastq` to `6_alignment`. \n",
    "2. In the `Snakefile`, add the following rules:  \n",
    "    a. `fetch_genome` - using a variation from the code from `2_genome_exploration`, download your reference genome and annotations.  \n",
    "    b. `star_sa` - use `STAR` to produce the suffix array of the reference genome.  \n",
    "    c. `star_align_first` - use `STAR` to perform first-pass alignment with all FASTQ files.  \n",
    "    d. `star_align_second` - use `STAR` to perform second-pass alignment with all FASTQ files.  \n",
    "    e. `hisat_align` - use `HISAT` to align all FASTQ files.  \n",
    "    f. `report` - use `multiqc` to aggregate all QC data into a single report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Snakefile` should not use any `wrappers` because we already have the relevant software installed in the `biol343` conda environment. The pipeline should run to completion when any instructor or classmate runs `snakemake --use-conda`."
