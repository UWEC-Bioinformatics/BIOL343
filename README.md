### Learning objectives

After completing this course, you will be able to:

1.	design and perform an RNA sequencing experiment,
2.	analyze RNA sequencing data in a professional manner,
3.	present an online, public portfolio of your version-controlled bioinformatics work.

## How is this class structured and how should I prepare for class?

This course is structured such that the eight weeks are “RNA sequencing bootcamp,” and the rest of the semester will be spent on a course-based undergraduate research experience, during which you will analyze novel, unpublished RNA-seq data. During bootcamp, each Monday will consist of a lecture about one step of an RNA-seq experiment (see the schedule at the end of the syllabus for a topic list). Tuesdays will consist of learning to use a new bioinformatics tool, working along with the instructor. Thursdays will include independent work time to use the new tools to analyze and reproduce a published dataset. You should set aside 3-5 hours per week to finish this work. Time in class will be provided for completing some of these projects, and it’s possible that an intrepid student can finish all their work within class.

## How will this class be graded?

We will use an alternative grading approach known as specifications grading. This grading scheme consists of categories of assessments (attendance, weekly homework, final project), each of which is graded as satisfactory/unsatisfactory. Final letter grades will be calculated based on your accumulation of satisfactory assessments. See below for the category breakdown:

| Category      | A | B | C | D | F |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Attendance    | >=13/14 perfect weeks | 12/14 perfect weeks | 11/14 perfect weeks | 10/14 perfect weeks | Less than 10/14 perfect weeks |
| Homework      | >=8/9 satisfactory homework submissions | 7/9 satisfactory homework submissions | 6/9 satisfactory homework submissions |  5/9 satisfactory homework submissions | Less than 5 satisfactory homework submissions |
| Final Project | Requirements for (B), plus a snakemake'd pipeline | Requirements for (C), plus version controlled work | Generation of a count matrix using a notebook with QC evaluation and parameter justification | Partial progress toward a count matrix | Unsatisfactory progress towards a count matrix |

The Final Grade will be equal to the Final Project grade. Plus/minus grades will be decided by the other two categories: if both category grades are higher than the Final Project, the Final Grade will be Final Project+; if both category grades are lower than the Final Project, the Final Grade will be Final Project-. 

Homework submitted after the due date/time will be marked Missing and will not be able to be revised. If submitted prior to the due date/time, homework marked as Needs Revision can be revised as many times as needed in order to achieve a Satisfactory mark. Rubrics and grades will be tracked on Canvas.

## Am I expected to come to class?

I hope that this course is one that you enjoy and fondly look back upon. That is, I hope you want to come to class each week and arrive on time. Attendance will be graded based on the above specification. Arrival >10 minutes after scheduled class start time will result in loss of credit. A list of authorized absences can be found at https://www.uwec.edu/kb/article/class-attendance-and-authorized-absence-policies/#authorized-absences.

## How do I get help and special accommodations for the class?

I have two weekly slots set aside to allow students to drop-in and receive personalized help and instruction (you can find those slots at the top of the syllabus.) Students are also always welcome to drop-by my office (provided I’m there and the door is open), and I’m happy to schedule personal appointments as well. Really, drop-in hours are for you, not for me. ***Please use them.***

UWEC has numerous resources on campus to help students learn and succeed in their coursework. The list of these services can be found at: https://www.uwec.edu/academic-skills-center/. 

### Students requiring special accommodations

It is important to me that every student has every opportunity to succeed in this course. Any student who has a disability and needs classroom accommodations should contact me and the Services for Students with Disabilities Office in Centennial Hall 2106 at the beginning of the semester.

### Students who are non-native speakers of English

All quizzes and exams will be administered in class on Canvas. Any student who is a non-native speaker of English may request extended test-taking time if approved by the Academic Skills Center or Department of Languages. Verification is required at least one week before any quiz or exam for which the accommodation is requested.

## How do I get help with non-class issues?

As your instructor, I am very concerned with your success in this class. As a human, I am more concerned with your flourishing as a student and unique, valuable individual. If there are ways in which you think I can specifically assist you, please reach out to me privately. When we talk, I resolve to listen, to create a safe and non-judgmental space, and to do what I can to help. At that meeting, it’s also likely that I will refer you to other on-campus resources, such as those listed at: https://www.uwec.edu/dean-of-students/support-resources/. 

As a Wisconsin State employee, I am obligated to report any claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Please know that any such information revealed to me will be forwarded to the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students office may reach out to you to offer resources and support. If you wish to disclose this information to a confidential resource, you may speak to someone in the Center for Awareness of Sexual Assault, Counseling Services, or Student Health Services.

## Can I use generative AI to help me write code?

In short, no. Co-coding AI tools like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot can be useful, and I have used them before. There may be a time when I show you how to install the Copilot extension for VS Code and provide instruction on how to use it, noting where it’s useful and not so useful. However, the goal of this class it to learn to develop and use bioinformatics tools, and using AI to quickly write code or build pipelines circumnavigates the learning experience. It will also not help you get a better grade, because your code will never be graded for elegance or cleverness, and a good deal of coding will be done in class.

It's very likely I’ll be able to detect AI generated material. Any use of generative AI to complete homework assignments or projects will be treated as academic misconduct. See below for further details.

## Miscellaneous

### Academic Integrity

Please don’t cheat or perform other types of academic misconduct. As described in the BluGold Student Conduct Code under student academic misconduct, “Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, for the appropriate citation of sources, and for the respect of others’ academic endeavors.” These student responsibilities are important, and deviations from these responsibilities have consequences. The disciplinary procedures and penalties for academic misconduct are described on the UW-Eau Claire Dean of Students web site: https://www.uwec.edu/kb/article/blugold-student-conduct-code/.

### Dropping the Class 
The last day to drop the class without record is September 17.  The last day to withdraw from class and receive a “W” is November 12. You can find the full academic calendar, including add and drop dates, here: https://www.uwec.edu/offices-services/blugold-central/academic-planning/academic-and-registration-calendars.
