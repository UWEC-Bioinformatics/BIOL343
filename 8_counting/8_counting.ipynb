    "<img src=\"assets/duplicates_2.png\" width=\"400\">\n",

    "Indeed, this was true of all samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/duplicates.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different reasons for why a sample would have many duplicate reads. The biggest reason is that, during library prep, there was a log amount of input RNA. This means that when the library is finished with the PCR enrichment steps, the library fragments are amplified so many times that many of the reads derived from duplicate fragments:\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/pcr.png\" width=\"400\">\n",

    "Many duplicate reads are a hallmark of RNA-seq experiments where the original tissue source was small, which resulted in low amounts of RNA being extracted. There are many different steps at which you can remove duplicates. Some people remove them from the FASTQ during trimming/filter, but my opinion is that is unnecessary and can potentially remove data that you might later be interested in. I think it's better to align the duplicates but mark them (rather than removing them) so that they aren't counted during the counting step. If you look at last week's [notebook on SAM/BAM QC](../7_alignment_qc/7_alignment_qc.ipynb), you'll see that the bit flag 0x400 represents a duplicate read. So, we can use a tool to update the read's flag if it is suspected to be a duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will first use [Picard Tools to mark the duplicate reads](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard); then we'll tell featureCounts to ignore anything marked as a duplicate (with the the `--ignoreDup` flag). This flag will analyze the FLAG field in the BAM and ignore any alignment that contains the duplicate bit."
